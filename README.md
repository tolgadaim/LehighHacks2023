## By Leo Chen, Tolga Daim, and Sean Pandaleon
Polar Bear Crossing is a game that teaches children about the impact of climate change on polar bears and how to help combat it. 
In the game, the player controls a polar bear as it navigates melting ice glaciers, avoiding obstacles and answering multiple-choice questions about climate change and sustainability.
Polar Bear Crossing also has a website to inform users about the game and the impacts of climate change for polar bears and the world. 

### Impact
Through playing Polar Bear Crossing, children can learn about the impact of climate change on polar bears and their habitats.
They can also learn about ways they can help combat climate change and promote sustainability in their own lives. 
**By raising awareness and promoting education about these issues, Polar Bear Crossing can contribute to a more sustainable future for both humans and polar bears.**

### Instructions
To play Polar Bear Crossing, simply go to the release section of the repo and download the game and run it on your windows computer.
Use the arrow keys to navigate the polar bear from one ice glacier to the next and answer questions along the way. 
The player starts with 15 seconds on the clock and needs to find fish to extend the time. 
Once the bear eats the fish, a question pops up, and upon a correct answer, the time is extended 10 seconds. 
When the clock hits 0 or when the polar bear falls into the melting glaciers the game ends.
